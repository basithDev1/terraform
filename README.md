Secure Web Hosting on Azure with Terraform
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a secure web hosting environment on Microsoft Azure using Terraform for infrastructure automation. The solution includes a Linux VM running an Nginx Web Server, protected by an Azure Firewall that restricts HTTP access to only a specific IP (e.g., your home router IP).

Key Components:
Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

Azure Subnet

Azure Firewall for traffic control

Linux VM with Nginx for web hosting

Firewall Policy to allow HTTP access from a specific IP address

Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC)
